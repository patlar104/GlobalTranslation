- **Professional Material 3 UI with expressive theme**
- **Performance optimized with throttling**
- **✅ Built and installed successfully on Pixel 9 Pro XL**

### 📋 Testing Recommendations:

1. ✅ **Camera Permission Flow** - Grant/deny scenarios
2. ✅ **Text Recognition** - Test with printed text, signs, menus
3. ✅ **Translation Accuracy** - Verify multiple language pairs
4. ✅ **Flash Toggle** - Test in low-light conditions
5. ✅ **Performance** - Verify no lag during processing
6. ✅ **Error Handling** - Test without WiFi, without models

## 🎯 Key Achievements

1. ✅ **Material 3 Theme** - Modern, expressive design system implemented
2. ✅ **Camera Translation** - Full real-time OCR + translation pipeline
3. ✅ **Clean Architecture** - Services, ViewModels, and UI properly separated
4. ✅ **Real-time Processing** - Throttled frame processing for performance
5. ✅ **Parallel Translation** - Multiple text blocks translated simultaneously
6. ✅ **Professional UX** - Permission flow, error handling, loading states

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Architecture Pattern (Proven)
```
UI Layer (Compose)
    ↓ collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
ViewModel (State Management)
    ↓ viewModelScope.launch
Service Layer (Business Logic)
    ↓ suspend functions + Result types
External APIs (ML Kit, CameraX)
```

### Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Frame processing throttled to 500ms intervals (avoid overload)
- ✅ Parallel async translation of multiple text blocks (coroutines)
- ✅ Proper image cleanup with `imageProxy.close()` (memory management)
- ✅ Freeze frame mode to reduce processing (user control)
- ✅ BackpressureStrategy.KEEP_ONLY_LATEST (CameraX optimization)

### Error Handling
- ✅ Result types for all service calls (type-safe errors)
- ✅ User-friendly error messages with WiFi guidance
- ✅ Automatic error clearing on success
- ✅ Graceful fallbacks for translation failures

---

## 📝 Code Quality Checklist

- ✅ All services use @Singleton with @Inject constructor
- ✅ ViewModels use StateFlow best practices (private MutableStateFlow + public StateFlow)
- ✅ Proper resource cleanup (imageProxy.close(), recognizer.close())
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with Result<T> types
- ✅ Coroutine-based async operations with viewModelScope
- ✅ Type-safe state management with data classes
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns (UI, ViewModel, Service)
- ✅ Documented with KDoc comments
- ✅ Follows Material 3 design guidelines
- ✅ Permission handling with Accompanist
