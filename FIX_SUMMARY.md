# Fix Summary: TextField Test Failures

## Issue
Two tests were failing with assertion errors:
1. `textInputScreen_displaysInputField`
2. `textInputScreen_clearButton_clearsInput`

Error message:
```
java.lang.AssertionError: Failed to assert the following: (Text + EditableText = [])
```

## What Was Wrong
The tests were using:
```kotlin
assertTextEquals("", includeEditableText = true)
```

But Material3's `OutlinedTextField` includes the **label text** in its Text semantics. The assertion was expecting an empty array, but was finding the label "Enter text to translate".

## The Fix
Changed both failing assertions to:
```kotlin
assertTextEquals("Enter text to translate", "", includeEditableText = true)
```

This tells the assertion to expect:
- **First parameter**: Label text ("Enter text to translate")
- **Second parameter**: Editable text value (empty string "")

## Why This Works
`assertTextEquals(..., includeEditableText = true)` checks **both**:
1. Text semantics (which includes the label)
2. EditableText semantics (which contains the actual input)

By providing both values, the assertion now passes correctly.

## Files Modified
- ✅ `app/src/androidTest/java/com/example/globaltranslation/ui/textinput/TextInputScreenTest.kt`
  - Fixed line 78: `textInputScreen_displaysInputField()` test
  - Fixed line 145: `textInputScreen_clearButton_clearsInput()` test

## Documentation Added
- ✅ `TEXTFIELD_LABEL_FIX.md` - Comprehensive guide with examples
- ✅ `COMPOSE_BOM_2025_10_00_FIX.md` - Updated with new pattern
- ✅ `TESTING_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md` - Updated best practices

## Next Steps
Run the tests again to verify the fix:
```bash
./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest
```

Both tests should now pass! ✅
