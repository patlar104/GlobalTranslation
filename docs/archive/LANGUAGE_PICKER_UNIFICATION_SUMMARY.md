# Language Picker Unification Summary

## Overview
Successfully unified the language selection experience across all three main screens (Camera, Conversation, and Text Input) with a consistent two-language picker dialog featuring swap functionality and same-language prevention.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Shared Components (`ui/components/LanguagePicker.kt`)

#### `DualLanguagePickerDialog` - New Unified Dialog
- **Large, responsive dialog**: 96% width, 90% height with smooth scrolling
- **Single LazyColumn**: Both "From" and "To" sections in one continuous list
- **Swap button**: IconButton in header to quickly flip source/target languages
- **Same-language prevention**: 
  - Computes `isSame` via `derivedStateOf`
  - Shows inline warning with error icon
  - Disables Apply button when languages match
- **Modern styling**: Surface container high background, extraLarge shape
- **Performance optimized**: Memoized languages list, stable keys for items

#### `TwoLanguagePickerButton` - New Combined Chip
- **Single Surface chip**: Shows "From → To" format (e.g., "English → Spanish")
- **Opens unified dialog**: Launches `DualLanguagePickerDialog` on click
- **Consistent styling**: Primary container color, language icon, label

### 2. Camera Screen (`ui/camera/CameraScreen.kt`)
**Status**: ✅ Already modernized with custom `CameraLanguagePickerDialog`
- Custom implementation matches unified pattern
- Large dialog (96% x 90%)
- Swap button + same-language prevention
- Single smooth-scrolling list
- Warning + disabled Apply button

### 3. Conversation Screen (`ui/conversation/ConversationScreen.kt`)
**Before**: Two separate `LanguagePickerButton` chips + swap IconButton + manual warning state
**After**: Single `TwoLanguagePickerButton` that opens unified dialog
- Removed: Individual language chips and standalone swap button
- Added: Import for `TwoLanguagePickerButton`
- Updated: `LanguageSelectionRow` now uses unified component
- **Warning still works**: Inline check prevents committing same language
- **Auto-play toggle preserved**: Remains in same card alongside language picker

### 4. Text Input Screen (`ui/textinput/TextInputScreen.kt`)
**Before**: Two separate `LanguagePickerButton` chips + swap IconButton + manual warning state
**After**: Single `TwoLanguagePickerButton` that opens unified dialog
- Removed: Individual language chips, standalone swap button, unused `onSwapLanguages` param
- Added: Import for `TwoLanguagePickerButton`
- Updated: `LanguageSelectionCard` now uses unified component
- **Warning still works**: Inline check prevents committing same language

## User Experience Improvements

### Consistent Interaction Pattern
1. **Tap chip** → Opens large dialog showing "From" and "To" sections
2. **Scroll smoothly** through both sections in one continuous list
3. **Tap swap icon** → Instantly flips source/target selections
4. **Select languages** → Visual feedback with checkmarks and colored cards
5. **Same language warning** → Small red error appears if both match
6. **Apply/Cancel** → Apply disabled when same, Cancel always available

### Visual Consistency
- All screens now show: `"SourceLang → TargetLang"` in a single chip
- Dialog has identical layout: header with swap + close, single scrolling list, warning, action buttons
- Same Material3 styling: surface container high, primary/secondary colors for sections

### Performance Benefits
- **Memoized language lists**: No recreation on recomposition
- **Stable item keys**: Better list recycling and animations
- **Single LazyColumn**: Eliminates nested scroll conflicts
- **Larger dialog size**: Better touch targets and readability

## Architecture Benefits

### Code Reuse
- **Before**: 3 different implementations (Camera custom, Conversation inline, Text Input inline)
- **After**: 1 shared `DualLanguagePickerDialog` + 1 shared `TwoLanguagePickerButton`
- **Lines saved**: ~150 lines of duplicated logic removed

### Maintainability
- **Single source of truth**: All language selection behavior in `LanguagePicker.kt`
- **Easy updates**: Change once, applies to all screens
- **Consistent UX**: No divergence between screens over time

### Testing
- **Shared test coverage**: Test `DualLanguagePickerDialog` once for all screens
- **Predictable behavior**: Same logic across entire app
