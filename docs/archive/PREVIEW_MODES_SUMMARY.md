# üé® Android Studio Preview Modes - Quick Summary

## What I Found

Your app now has significantly improved support for Android Studio preview modes. Phase 1 is complete across all screens, with standardized annotations and theming. Phase 2 is now complete with live interactive previews on all screens. Phase 3 has started with a consolidated UI-check composite annotation.

### ‚úÖ What's Working

- ConversationScreen: Full support with interactive live preview, multiple states, shared data
- LanguageScreen: Extracted `LanguageScreenContent`, added `LanguageUiStatePreviewProvider`, added states and a live interactive preview
- TextInputScreen & CameraScreen: Strong state previews using `PreviewParameterProvider`; content extracted for previewing
- Shared Components:
    - `PreviewScaffold` wrapper for consistent theming/surface in all previews
    - `Previews.kt` with `@MultiDevicePreview`, new `@DesignVariantPreview`, `@FontScalePreview`, and `@DynamicColorPreview`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What's Left

1. UI Check Mode (In Progress)
    - New `@UiCheckPreview` composite added (LTR/RTL, light/dark, 2.0x font)
    - Next: targeted previews for touch target overlays and explicit contrast checks
    - Continue auditing `contentDescription` usage and semantics

## The Three Preview Modes Explained

### 1. Standard Preview Mode (‚úÖ Complete for Phase 1)

What it is: Static UI previews with multiple device/theme/font scale variants  
Status: Implemented across all screens via `@MultiDevicePreview` + `@DesignVariantPreview` (+ `PreviewScaffold`)  
**To use**: Open any `*Screen.kt` file in Android Studio, preview panel shows UI

### 2. Interactive Mode (Partial ‚úÖ)

What it is: Live interaction with composables‚Äîclick buttons, type text, see state changes  
Status: ConversationScreen and LanguageScreen implemented; TextInput and Camera pending  
**To use**: Click play icon (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) in preview pane labeled "Run Interactive Mode"

### 3. UI Check Mode (Not Implemented ‚ùå)

**What it is**: Automated accessibility and design system validation  
**Status**: No dedicated validation previews  
**To use**: Click "Run UI Check" button in preview pane (when implemented)

## Implementation Plan Created

There's a comprehensive **4-phase implementation plan** in:
üìÑ `PREVIEW_MODES_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

### Phase Breakdown

**Phase 1: Complete Standard Preview Support** (Done)

- Added composite annotations: `@DesignVariantPreview`, `@FontScalePreview`, `@DynamicColorPreview`
- Extracted `LanguageScreenContent`, added `LanguageUiStatePreviewProvider`
- Added `LanguageScreenStatesPreview` and `LanguageScreenLivePreview`
- Unified theming with `PreviewScaffold`

**Phase 2: Interactive Mode Full Support** (Done)

- Added `TextInputScreenLivePreview` with mutable state management
- Added `CameraOverlayLivePreview` with flash/capture interactions
- Verified interactive previews build successfully

**Phase 3: UI Check Mode Support** (In progress)

- Audit all screens for missing `contentDescription`
- Create accessibility validation previews (color contrast, touch targets)
- Add `semantics {}` blocks for custom interactive elements
- Fix all critical accessibility issues

**Phase 4: Shared Utilities Enhancement** (1 week)

- Expand `PreviewData.kt` with language models and text blocks
- Create `PreviewScaffolds.kt` with reusable wrappers
- Enhance `Previews.kt` with new annotation combinations
- Document preview utilities for developers

## What changed for LanguageScreen

- Extracted `LanguageScreenContent` for pure UI previews
- Implemented `LanguageUiStatePreviewProvider` with multiple states
- Added `LanguageScreenStatesPreview` and `LanguageScreenLivePreview`
- Adopted `PreviewScaffold`, `@MultiDevicePreview`, and `@DesignVariantPreview`

## Benefits of Full Implementation

### For Development

- **Faster iteration**: See UI changes without running the app
- **Test edge cases**: Preview error states, empty states, loading states
- **Accessibility validation**: Catch a11y issues before QA

### For Team

- **Better code reviews**: Screenshots auto-generated from previews
- **Consistent UI**: Preview parameters enforce state variety testing
- **Documentation**: Previews serve as living UI documentation

### For Users

- **Higher quality**: Catch UI bugs earlier in development cycle
- **Better accessibility**: Automated checks ensure inclusive design
- **Polished experience**: More thorough testing across devices/themes

## Next Steps

1. **Review the full plan**: `PREVIEW_MODES_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
2. **Start with Phase 1**: Add missing annotations (low effort, high value)
3. **Fix LanguageScreen**: Extract content composable and add preview provider
4. **Test interactive mode**: Verify existing ConversationScreen preview works in your Android Studio

## Example: How to Test Interactive Mode Now

1. Open `ConversationScreen.kt` or `LanguageScreen.kt` in Android Studio
2. Find `ConversationScreenLivePreview()` or `LanguageScreenLivePreview()`
3. In preview pane, click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è play icon
4. Try:
   - Click language picker buttons
   - Toggle auto-play
   - Click swap languages
        - Click clear conversation / start a download
5. Watch the UI update in real-time!

## Questions to Consider

Before implementing, decide:

1. **Priority**: Which phase is most valuable for your team?
2. **Resources**: Do you have 1-4 weeks for full implementation?
3. **Tooling**: Are you using Android Studio Ladybug or newer? (Interactive mode requires recent version)
4. **Testing**: Will you use previews for visual regression testing?

**Ready to implement?** Start with Phase 1 for quick wins, or tackle the LanguageScreen fix as a proof-of-concept.
