# Fix Summary: TextField Test Failures

## Issue
Two tests were failing with assertion errors:
1. `textInputScreen_displaysInputField`
2. `textInputScreen_clearButton_clearsInput`

Error message:
```
java.lang.AssertionError: Failed to assert the following: (Text + EditableText = [Enter text to translate,])
```

## What Was Wrong
The tests were using:
```kotlin
assertTextEquals("", includeEditableText = true)
```

But Material3's `OutlinedTextField` with a label only exposes the label text in its semantics when empty. Using `includeEditableText = true` with multiple parameters was causing assertion failures.

## The Fix
Changed the failing assertions to supply the full `Text + EditableText` sequence expected by Compose BOM 2025.10.00:
```kotlin
// Empty & unfocused: label + empty editable
assertTextEquals("Enter text to translate", "")

// Empty & focused (placeholder visible): label + placeholder + empty editable
assertTextEquals("Enter text to translate", "Type your message here...", "")
```

This matches the actual semantics produced by Material3 and avoids toggling `includeEditableText`.

## Why This Works
Material3's `OutlinedTextField`:
- **When empty**: Only the label is present in semantics → check with `assertTextEquals("label")`
- **When filled**: Both label and content are present → check with `assertTextContains("content")`

The simplified approach avoids the complexity of `includeEditableText` parameter.

## Files Modified
- ✅ `app/src/androidTest/java/com/example/globaltranslation/ui/textinput/TextInputScreenTest.kt`
  - `textInputScreen_displaysInputField()` → includes empty editable string
  - `textInputScreen_clearButton_clearsInput()` → includes placeholder and empty editable when focused

## Documentation Added
- ✅ `TEXTFIELD_LABEL_FIX.md` - Comprehensive guide with examples
- ✅ `COMPOSE_BOM_2025_10_00_FIX.md` - Updated with new pattern
- ✅ `TESTING_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md` - Updated best practices

## Next Steps
Run the tests again to verify the fix:
```bash
./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest
```

Both tests should now pass! ✅
