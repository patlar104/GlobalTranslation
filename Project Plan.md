## 🔧 Build Configuration Fixes Applied

### Critical Issues Resolved

1. **KSP Version Format** ✅
   - **Issue**: KSP versioning changed from `1.0.x` to `2.0.x` format
   - **Solution**: Updated from `2.2.20-1.0.20` to `2.2.20-2.0.2`
   - **Impact**: Enables Hilt annotation processing for Kotlin 2.2.20

2. **Missing Kotlin Android Plugin** ✅
   - **Issue**: `kotlin.android` plugin was missing from `app/build.gradle.kts`
   - **Solution**: Added `alias(libs.plugins.kotlin.android)` to plugins block
   - **Impact**: Enables proper Kotlin compilation and Hilt code generation

3. **JVM Target Mismatch** ✅
   - **Issue**: Java targeted JVM 11 but Kotlin defaulted to JVM 21
   - **Solution**: Added `kotlinOptions { jvmTarget = "11" }` to align with Java
   - **Impact**: Resolves compilation errors and ensures bytecode compatibility

4. **UI Component Parameter Mismatches** ✅
   - **Issue**: `LanguagePickerButton` calls used wrong parameter names
   - **Solution**: Changed `selectedLanguage` to `selectedLanguageCode` in all usages
   - **Impact**: Fixes compilation errors in ConversationScreen and TextInputScreen

5. **Alignment Type Error** ✅
   - **Issue**: Used `Alignment.Center` instead of `Alignment.CenterVertically` in Row
   - **Solution**: Corrected alignment type in TextInputScreen
   - **Impact**: Fixes type mismatch compilation error

### Build System Verification

All fixes verified with:
- ✅ Clean build successful

   - Save conversation history across app restarts
   - Cache language preferences

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement lazy loading for large conversation histories
   - Add pagination for translation history
   - Cache frequently used translations

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - More granular error types (network, model, permission)
   - Retry mechanisms for failed translations
   - Offline mode indicators

5. **Accessibility**
   - Add content descriptions for screen readers
   - Ensure proper focus management
   - Support dynamic text sizing

6. **Analytics**

**Note:** These are enhancements, not bugs or missing features. The current implementation follows best practices and is fully functional.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes Applied

### Model Download Status Inconsistency ✅ FIXED

**Issue Discovered**: Languages screen showed incorrect download status because it attempted translation to check if models exist, which would auto-download models instead of checking actual download status.

**Impact**:
- Languages screen showed "not downloaded" even when models were available
- Confusing UX when translations succeeded but status showed unavailable
- No clear warning about WiFi requirement for first-time downloads

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed `areModelsDownloaded()` to use `RemoteModelManager.getInstance()`
- Now properly checks model download status without triggering downloads
- Added clear error messages mentioning WiFi requirement
- Languages screen now shows accurate download status

**Files Modified**:
- `TranslationService.kt` - Fixed `areModelsDownloaded()` method
- `ConversationViewModel.kt` - Enhanced error message with WiFi guidance
- `TextInputViewModel.kt` - Enhanced error message with WiFi guidance

**Testing**:
- ✅ Languages screen shows accurate download status
- ✅ Translation auto-downloads models on WiFi when needed
- ✅ Clear error on cellular without models
- ✅ No false positives in download status

### Text Input Screen Copy/Speak Functionality ✅ FIXED

**Issue Discovered**: Copy button and speak buttons were not implemented in the text input translation screen (marked as TODO).

**Impact**:
- Copy button didn't copy translated text to clipboard
- Speak buttons were placeholder TODOs with no functionality
- Inconsistent UX compared to conversation screen

**Fix Applied**:
- Added clipboard manager integration for copying translations
- Injected TextToSpeechService into TextInputViewModel
- Implemented `speakText()` function with locale conversion
- Added speak buttons for both original and translated text
- Separated "copy to clipboard" from "copy to input" with distinct icons

**Files Modified**:
- `TextInputScreen.kt` - Added clipboard manager, speak/copy callbacks
- `TextInputViewModel.kt` - Injected TTS service, added speakText() method

**Testing**:
- ✅ Copy button copies translated text to system clipboard
- ✅ Speak buttons work for both original and translated text
- ✅ History items have both clipboard copy and input copy buttons
- ✅ TTS properly cleans up in onCleared()

### Language Model Deletion ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Issue Discovered**: Delete/Remove button for downloaded language models was a TODO placeholder.

**Impact**:
- Users couldn't remove downloaded models to free storage space
- No way to re-download corrupted models

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `deleteModel()` method to TranslationService
- Uses RemoteModelManager to delete models from storage
- Cleans up cached translators to free memory
- Added `deleteLanguage()` function to LanguageViewModel
- Connected Remove button in UI with delete icon

**Files Modified**:
- `TranslationService.kt` - Added deleteModel() method
- `LanguageViewModel.kt` - Added deleteLanguage() function
- `LanguageScreen.kt` - Connected onDelete callback with icon

**Testing**:
- ✅ Remove button deletes models from device storage
- ✅ UI updates immediately to show "Not downloaded"
- ✅ Cached translators cleaned up properly
- ✅ English model protected (cannot be deleted)
- ✅ Error handling for deletion failures
