/**
 * ML Kit Provider Configuration and Constants.
 * 
 * This object centralizes configuration for all ML Kit providers in the application,
 * ensuring consistency and making it easier to tune performance parameters.
 * 
 * ## Design Principles:
 * - Centralized configuration for easy maintenance
 * - Well-documented default values
 * - Performance tuning based on device capabilities
 * 
 * ## Usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * val timeout = MlKitConfig.DEFAULT_OPERATION_TIMEOUT_MS
 * val maxRetries = MlKitConfig.MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS
 * ```
